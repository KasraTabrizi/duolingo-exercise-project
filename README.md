## Purpose
I am a huge fan of Duolingo and I use it daily to learn new languages.
As a challenge, I decided to recreate the Duolingo exercise UI with plain HTML, CSS and Javascript.
On of the exercises consist of a sentence that you need to translate. Below you get a list of words randomly ordered in the language you are learning. Clicking on the word, will cause it to move to the upper space. Selecting the right words to form the translated sentence to finish the exercise.

## TODO
1. Create HTML
2. Create CSS
3. Create Script
