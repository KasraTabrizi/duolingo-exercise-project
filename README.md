# Duolingo Click On Words Exercise

_I am a huge fan of Duolingo and I use it daily to learn Spanish. As a challenge, I decided to recreate the Duolingo Click On Words Exercise UI with plain HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript._

Note: This is made for educational purpose only. This project **will not** be used for commercial use.

## Goal

The goal is to try to recreate the UI/UX but also the logic as close as Duolingo's version.

## User Story

- As user you get an English sentence which you have to translate into Spanish.
- At the bottom of the page I get a list of randomly ordered words in Spanish.
- Clicking on a word, will move it to an upper empty space.
- By clicking the correct words in the correct order, you can form the translated version of the given sentence.
- Not all words from the list are needed to form the sentence. This will give an extra challenge to the user.
- When you accidently selected the wrong word, by clicking on the word again, it will move back to its original position.
- The other selected words will slide to the left to fill the empty space.
- When ready, clicking on the **Check** button will verify whether your formed sentence is correct or not. Clicking on the **Skip** Button, will skip to the next exercise.
